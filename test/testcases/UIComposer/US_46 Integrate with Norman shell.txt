•	When the user selects the option to navigate to the UI composer the UI composer shall be launched within the shell
•	When the user navigates to a different component of the Norman shell, e.g. Forum, he hall see the other component. The current state of work in the UI composer shall not be lost, but be available the next time the user opens the UI composer.
