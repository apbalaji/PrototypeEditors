Description
Purpose/ goal of the test case	
Verify that an user be able to save a snapshot of his design saved 

Business scenario/User Story
	  
The user shall be able to save a snapshot of his design and continue working on the design. The saved version will capture the state of the design at that time.. 
 

Acceptance Criteria
•	The user shall be able to explicitly save a snapshot of the prototype
•	The user shall have an indication that the snapshot was successfully created
  
Preparations
Setup/Configuration steps (if necessary)
An user had signed up to Project Norman with the name, email address and password

User Logon Information/ Roles


Navigation path to reach the application (i.e. URL)


Test Scenarios 
                  

Verify the snapshot icon is available for taking snapshot of prototype    

	

Verify an user be able to click on the Snapshot icon for taking snapshot     

	

Verify an user be able to take a snapshot and save the snapshot of the prototype created by the user 

	

Verify an user be able to view the confirmation message info when the snaptshot has been saved successfully     

	

Verify an user be able to take the same snaptshot for the prototype multiple times        

	

Verify an user be able to view the generated URL of the snaptshot for the prototype        

	

Verify different URL is generated for the changes in  the prototype when the snaptshot is taken again       

Verify the following cases:
	1) create a project with 3 pages. 
	2) add 2 buttons to each page, and have them pointing to each other.  For example, 
		page 1: button 1 should navigate to page 2, button 2 should navigate to page 3;
		page 2: button 1 should navigate to page 1, button 2 should navigate to page 3;
