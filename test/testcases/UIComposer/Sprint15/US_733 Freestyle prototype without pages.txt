Description

As a designer, I need to be able to create prototypes based on Smart Templates (ST) or FreeStyle (FS). The Beta2 of BUILD does not allow mixing FS and ST pages. 
Therefore, I expect that the prototype will not have any pages by default. 
If I attempt to open the UI Composer (UC) from the Data Modeler (DM) and if I had not created pages until then, BUILD will take me to the PageMap (PM). 
There I will be able to add a page if I wish so.

Acceptance criteria:

•	When creating a new project/prototype a user shall not be able to see any default page being created in the Prototype page, except the link to the Page Map
•	When a user is in the Data Modeler right after creating a new project and wants to go to the composer directly (either by prompt or by clicking the composer link in the tool bar) the user goes to the page map, instead of the composer canvas, since there isn't any page in the prototype yet.

Preparations
Setup/Configuration steps (if necessary)
