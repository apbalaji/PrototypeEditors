Description:

Purpose/ goal of the test case:	
Provide messages to the user about the auto-save state.

Business scenario/User Story:

The user shall see the state of auto save in the Shell. While content in the UI composer is being saved the user shall see a 
message that a save is being processed. Once the saving process has completed, the user shall see a message that shows content 
was saved. When there hasn't been any recent save action, the user shall see when the UI composer was last saved. If an error 
occurs during saving, the user shall be notified of that error.

Acceptance Criteria:

•   If the UI composer is in the process of saving the user's work, the user shall see a message that saving is in progress. 
    This shall be shown until the UI composer finished saving or an error occurred.
•   Once the UI composer finishes saving, the user shall see a message that the saving is completed.
•    If no changes are made for more than 7 minutes, then the user shall see a message describing WHEN the UI composer last 
    saved the user's work (i.e. 'All changes saved at 1:07 p.m.).
•   If the UI composer experienced an error while saving, the user shall see a red rectangle with an error message that reads,
    "Error: Prototype not saved."
•   The user can click on the 'X' icon in the upper-right corner of error message to get rid of it.
•    The error message shall provide the user with an option (link) to reload the page.
