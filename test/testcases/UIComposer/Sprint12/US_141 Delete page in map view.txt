Description:

Purpose/ goal of the test case:

The user shall be able to delete a page in the map view. 

Business scenario/User Story:

Acceptance Criteria:

•   The city view shall display all pages that are part of the project.
•    A user shall be able to delete a page in map view by clicking on the 'X' icon.
•    The user shall be notified that he is about to delete a page.
•   The user shall need to confirm that he wants to delete a page before it is removed (NOT IN SPRINT12).
•   If the page is the target of an action (e.g. setting a value of a control, being the target of a navigation), the user 
    shall be informed that this action will be removed.
•    The system shall remove the actions that target the deleted page. This is necessary to not break the prototype.
•    If the user deletes the first (leading) page in a prototype, the second page becomes the leading page.
•    Once the page is deleted the page above the deleted page shall be set as Home page.
•    If the first page is deleted, the new first page shall be set as home page after the deletion.
