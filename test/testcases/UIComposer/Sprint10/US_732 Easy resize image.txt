•	 Fit image to width of the canvas.
•	 Fill canvas with image.
•	 Lock image aspect Ratio.
•	 Move Image to 0,0 point on the ruler.
•	 When resizing horizontally the vertical dimension is set to auto-resize.

Preparations:

Setup/Configuration steps (if necessary).
A user has signed up into Project Norman with the name, email address and password.

Test Fit and Fill using formulas:
Fit = max (canvasWidth/newWidth, canvasHeight/newHeight)
Fill = min (canvasWidth/newWidth, canvasHeight/newHeight)
Navigation path to reach the application (i.e. URL)

Test Steps/Procedures:

1. Verify that the following fields are displayed in image properties panel after an image is dragged and dropped onto the 
    canvas:
    _  Size (width and height) by default 1280px-960px
    _  Scaling has FIT button and FILL button
    _  Width and Height fields are editable
    _  Width and Height fields only accept integer values
    _  Lock icon displayed between width and height
    

2. Verify when image is locked, if user changes the width of an image, then height will be auto adjusted to keep image's 
    aspect ratio.

3. Verify when image is locked, if user changes height size, then the width is auto adjusted.

4. Verify that if image is locked, the user could only enter integer number and px format, no %.

5. Verify when unlocked, if user change the width of an image, then the height will not be auto adjusted.

6. Verify when unlocked, if user changes the height of an image, then the width will not be auto adjusted.

7. Verify when unlocked, if user drags the height to resize, verify only height changed; width will not change.

8. Verify that if an image is unlocked, user could enter % to change value.

9. Verify Fit function works for image size smaller than canvas size in desktop form factor.
    _  Drag and drop an image size 800px (width) by 600px (height) to the middle of canvas.
    _  Click 'Fit' button in image properties panel.
    _  Verify image will move to 0,0 ruler position.
    _  Verify width size will be changed to 1280px, and height is 960px.

    _  Drag and drop image with size 1600 (width) by 1060 pixels. Verify image will auto fit to 1280px x 960px.
    _  Verify that no decimal number is displayed, will be rounded to integer.
