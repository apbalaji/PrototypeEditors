•	The image center shall be dropped at the cursor position.
•	If the image is dropped and the top left corner is off of the canvas, then the image will be positioned at 0,0.

Preparations:

Setup/Configuration steps (if necessary)
A user has signed up to Project Norman with the name, email address and password.
User Logon Information/Roles
Navigation path to reach the application (i.e. URL)


Test Steps/Procedures:

1. Verify that if the image is larger than the canvas, it will be resize to fit the canvas.
    Drag and drop an image size 1600 x 1060 pixels (width x height) from Mac Finder (or a folder in Windows system). 
    Verify that UIComposer will show height is 960 and width is 1280.

2. Drag and drop an image size 800 x 600 pixels from Mac Finder or Windows.  Verify that Norman will show height is 600,
    width is 800.

3. Drag drop an image size 1280 x 1024 pixels from Mac Finder or Windows.  Verify Norman will show correct height
    and width on both interactive mode and edit mode.

4. Verify that if the image is smaller than the canvas size, it will retain its original size.
    Drag and drop the image size 800 x 600 pixels.  Verify the original size of image is retained.
    In image properties panel, verify width has value 800 pixels, height has 600 pixels.

5. Verify that if user drops an image in the canvas, the center of the image will be where the arrow on the screen is set.

6. Verify that a large image will be positioned at the 0,0 position at the top left when an image is dropped.
   Drag and drop the image size 1600 x 1060 pixels.
   In this latest build, the image does not position itself at the 0, 0, but at the position where I ask it to drop.
   
7. Repeat step 1 to 6 against different image file formats. (png, gif, jpeg)
