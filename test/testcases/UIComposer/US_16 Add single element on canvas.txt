Business scenario/User Story #16
	  
The user shall be able to add individual UI elements (controls in UI5) to the canvas. The UI elements available to the user shall be displayed (e.g. on a palette).

Acceptance Criteria
•	The user shall see UI elements in the UI composer that are available to be added to the canvas, e.g. in a palette
•	The user shall have a visual indication if a UI element is a single control to distinguish it from a pattern
•	When moving a UI element onto the canvas the composer shall place the UI element in a manner that is defined by the UI framework used. A UI framework may not prescribe restrictions in the way of placing controls (e.g. Open UI 5 with absolute positioning), in which case placement is completely free form.
