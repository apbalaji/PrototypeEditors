PrototypeEditors
===============
The Prototype Editors is a merge of former UIComposer, SampleDataManager, DataModeler, SharedWorkSpace, PrototypeBuilder and Previewer repositories.

The main goal is to handle the user prototypes lifecycle using various clients (data modeler, ui composer, prototype builder) and sharing their persistence layers (sample data manager, shared workspace).
